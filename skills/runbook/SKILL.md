# /runbook

Create a runbook for an operational scenario.

## Steps

### 1. Identify the scenario
Ask user (or read from incident-commander report if invoked from incident):
- Title (the failure mode, e.g., "MCP authentication expires")
- When does this happen? (symptoms — what you observe)
- How to diagnose? (commands, log locations, what to look for)
- How to fix? (step-by-step recovery)
- How to prevent? (what change would stop this recurring)

### 2. Generate slug
Same convention as ADRs.

### 3. Write file
`docs/runbooks/<slug>.md`:

```markdown
# Runbook: <title>

Last updated: <YYYY-MM-DD>

## Symptom

<what the user / monitoring sees>

## Severity

<one of: critical (prod down) | high (degraded) | medium (manual workaround) | low (annoyance)>

## Diagnosis

```bash
# Commands to run
<command 1>
<command 2>
```

What to look for:
- <pattern in output>
- <pattern in logs>
- <metric threshold>

## Fix

### Immediate (stop the bleeding)

1. <step>
2. <step>

### Full recovery

1. <step>
2. <step>

## Prevention

- <change to prevent recurrence>
- <monitoring to add>

## Related

- <ADR # if applicable>
- <Other runbooks>
- <Incident postmortem if applicable>
```

### 4. Commit
- `git add docs/runbooks/<slug>.md`
- `git commit -m "docs: runbook — <title>"`
