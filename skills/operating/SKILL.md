description: Show how to operate Claude Code with the stack — what you actively do (/goodmorning, /handoff, /project-init, /budget-guard), what happens automatically (foreman orchestration, domain-mode review, approval gates), the per-repo tier/domain table, and where ADRs/runbooks live. Use when the user asks "how does this work", "what do I do", "how is this set up", or wants the operating guide / stack help.

# /operating

Present the operating guide below to the user. It is the canonical answer to
"how do I run Claude Code with the stack." The source of truth is
`claude-code-stack/docs/OPERATING.md` — if that file is reachable and newer,
prefer reading and showing it; otherwise show this copy.

# Operating Claude Code with the Stack

You operate as the **architect**. Foreman + the subagents are the dev team.
You set direction and approve at gates; you do not micromanage routing.

## What you actively do

| When | Do this | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Start of a session | `/goodmorning` | Loads the last handoff, git state, open PRs, CI. |
| End of a session | `/handoff` | Writes `.claude/next_prompt.md` so the next session resumes cleanly. Do it before you close. |
| Starting a new project | `/project-init` | Generates `.claude/stack-config.json`, scaffolds CLAUDE.md. Without it, foreman refuses to dispatch. |
| Before a bulk LLM job (>100 records) | `/budget-guard` or `/cost-gate` | Samples records, projects cost, refuses without your approval. Stops surprise bills. |
| Want to see config | `/default-settings` | Read-only view of global defaults + this project's stack-config. |
| Want this guide | `/operating` | Shows this. |

## What happens automatically

- **Foreman orchestrates** — reads the repo's `.claude/stack-config.json`,
  classifies the task, dispatches the right subagents. You don't pick them.
- **`domain_mode` enforces extra review:** `financial-code` → full review
  chain + validator cross-checks real numbers; `ui-design` → designer
  inventory + design-match diff; `data-operation` → mandatory coverage
  snapshots on bulk writes.
- **Approval gates** — Claude PAUSES for your OK at set points (after
  architect, after validator, before merge, …). The pause is the stack
  working, not a bug.
- **Caveman communication mode** is on by default.

## Per-repo configuration

| Repo (example) | Tier | domain_mode |
|---|---|---|
| a thin monitoring repo | 1 | — |
| an isolated service / MCP server | 2 | — |
| a delivery pipeline | 3 | financial-code |
| a complex application | 4 | financial-code |
| a bulk data pipeline | 5 | data-operation |
| a dashboard suite | 5 | ui-design |

## Where to look for detail

Every audited repo has: `docs/ADRs/` (why decisions were made),
`docs/runbooks/` (what to do when something breaks), `docs/ONBOARDING.md`
(a successor's first day), `docs/architecture/data-flow.md`.

## Rules that bite if forgotten

- No `stack-config.json` → foreman refuses. Run `/project-init`.
- Skipping `/handoff` → the next session starts blind.
- Bulk LLM jobs without `/budget-guard` → surprise bills.
- An approval-gate pause is intentional — answer it, don't treat it as stuck.
