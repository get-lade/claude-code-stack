# UserPromptSubmit hook: simple-talk modifier (ADR-032).
#
# Reads session_prefs.simple_talk from the live session-state file and, when set
# to "plain" or "caveman", injects a per-turn directive shaping HOW plainly the
# assistant writes. This is the wording/jargon axis — orthogonal to
# communication_style (which sets length via brevity-drift budgets).
# "off" (default) = silent, zero behavior change.
#
# Every-turn (not SessionStart-once) on purpose: like brevity-drift.sh, the
# directive must stay fresh as context grows, or the model drifts back.
#
# Fail-safe: any problem -> exit 0 with no output. Never blocks or corrupts a turn.
