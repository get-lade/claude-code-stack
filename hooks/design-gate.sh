# PreToolUse[Edit|Write] hook: superpowers design-before-code gate (ADR-021).
#
# When ultracode is ON, deny edits to SOURCE files unless an approved design
# marker exists. With ultracode OFF (the default) this hook is silent — it never
# blocks normal work. It always allows docs / config / tests so the spec, plan,
# and tests that satisfy the gate can be written freely.
#
# Reuses the ADR-019 §3 governance base: session-state read, the
# permissionDecision:deny shape, the same registration mechanism as
# irreversible-deny.sh. Fail-OPEN: any error allows the edit (a gate failure must
# never brick editing).
#
# Marker: ~/.claude/session-state/design-approved.json -> {"active": true},
# written by /plan or /loop-engineer on approval. The gate is the enforcement;
# /plan is the authoring path (ADR-021 reconciliation).

# would leak into another that never approved anything. The legacy unscoped file

# written before per-session scoping, and for runtimes that pass no session_id).
