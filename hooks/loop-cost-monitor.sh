# PreToolUse hook: live mid-flight cost monitor for the loop-engineering control
# plane (ADR-019 Phase 2 — closes the within-iteration runaway gap that the
# between-iteration Stop-hook accrual leaves open).
#
# During an ACTIVE loop with a per_run_budget_usd, on every tool call it sums the
# real logged cost for this loop_id (loop_live_cost) and, if it has reached the
# budget, DENIES the call and marks the loop budget_exceeded so the next Stop
# releases. Outside a loop, or with no budget, it stays silent. Fail-OPEN: any
# error allows the tool (never crash the session over a monitoring failure).
#
# This complements (does not replace) the Stop-hook's between-iteration accrual:
# the Stop-hook catches overruns between iterations; this catches a single
# iteration that blows the budget without ever stopping.
