# Per-project tenant-pack consumption (M3, ADR-034 §4). Sourced by the
# /project-init skill. Where pack-installer.sh composes a pack into the GLOBAL
# ~/.claude at install time, these functions consume the already-landed pack
# into a single PROJECT repo: stamp the tenant id, apply the CLAUDE.md fragment
# to the project's own overlay region, and vendor the pack's standards/ files
# into the repo as committed files (retiring the old symlink+LaunchAgent sync).
#
# apply_org_overlay_section (ADR-013 amendment #3) is reused from
# pack-installer.sh — sourcing that file only defines functions (no top-level
# execution), and apply_org_overlay_section itself needs only awk/grep.
#
# Callers run these with errexit suppressed (`if ! vendor_tenant_standards`),
# so every fallible step is checked explicitly — never rely on set -e here.
#
# Security posture (tenant isolation, per cross-family review): a pack is
# untrusted input. Both the pack side (source) and the repo side (destination)
# are canonicalized with `pwd -P` and containment-checked, and final components
# are refused if they are symlinks — mirroring pack-installer.sh::validate_pack.
# A lexical `..`/absolute check alone is NOT sufficient (a symlinked file or
# intermediate dir escapes it), so realpath containment is the real guard.
#
# Threat model / scope (validate-then-copy TOCTOU): checks and the copy are
# separate syscalls. This is acceptable HERE because /project-init runs
# synchronously in a single user session over a pack dir that was written by a
# trusted `install.sh --pack` step and a repo the same user owns — neither is
# concurrently mutated by another principal during the run. We are NOT
# defending against an attacker with concurrent write access to the pack dir or
# repo tree mid-run; if that ever becomes part of the model, the copies must
# move to O_NOFOLLOW fds / copy-then-atomic-rename. To limit blast radius we do
# still: refuse symlinked final components, and break hardlinks on the
# destination (rm before cp) so a pre-existing hardlinked dest cannot be written
# through to an outside inode. Residual (documented, accepted): NFC/NFD Unicode
# path collisions are not folded — packs come from the trusted install step.
