# Adversarial-review model router (ADR-025).
#
# WHY: the adversarial-review agents (reviewer, security-auditor, product-critic)
# used to run EVERY review on the most expensive tier — gpt-5.5 @ reasoning
# effort=high via the Codex CLI, over a WHOLE-REPO cold read. Logs showed ~210
# review runs/month at ~950K tokens each (~$200). Most diffs are routine; paying
# frontier-tier-high-effort on all of them is the cost driver.
#
# This router classifies a diff's STAKES (cheaply, deterministically, from
# changed paths + domain-mode/sensitivity signals) and selects a tier:
#
#   high     → Codex / gpt-5.5 @ high     (auth, crypto, payment, migration, RLS…)
#   routine  → local Qwen first, escalate → Codex / gpt-5.4 @ medium
#
# Cross-family integrity (ADR-011) is preserved on BOTH tiers: local Qwen
# (Alibaba) and gpt-5.x (OpenAI) are each a different model family than the
# Claude implementer. The router never routes review to a Claude model.
#
# It also fixes SCOPE: every tier reviews the DIFF (base..head), not the whole
# repo — the single biggest token lever, applied even to high-stakes reviews.
#
# CONFIG-DRIVEN MODELS (ADR-025 + Tier-5 forward-compat): the tier model IDs are
# NOT hardcoded. Resolution order, highest first:
#   1. environment variable  (REVIEW_HIGH_MODEL, REVIEW_ROUTINE_MODEL, …)
#   2. config/model-routing.json  ".review_tiers.*"  (via jq, if present)
#   3. built-in default
# So when the Tier-5 box lands, repoint the routine/escalation/high models in
# config (or via env) — no edit to this script.
#
# USAGE
#   source "$DIR/review-router.sh"
#   rr_run <agent> [base] [head]   # prints verdict block, sets RR_* vars
#   rr_log_route <agent> <stakes> <engine> <model> <scope> <escalated>
#
# After rr_run, the caller obeys:
#   RR_STAKES      high | routine
#   RR_ENGINE      local | codex          (initial engine to invoke)
#   RR_MODEL       <resolved routine/high model id>
#   RR_EFFORT      high | medium | n/a    (reasoning effort for codex tiers)
#   RR_SCOPE       diff                   (always diff — scope fix)
#   RR_ESC_ENGINE  codex                  (escalation target for routine)
#   RR_ESC_MODEL   <resolved escalation model id>
#   RR_ESC_EFFORT  medium
#   RR_REASON      one-line why this stakes class was chosen

# Paths whose presence in a diff marks it high-stakes. Matched case-insensitively

# false-high: a false "high" only costs money, but a false "routine" sends risky
# code to the cheap tier — the failure mode that matters for a security engine.
# (ADR-025 review: expanded to cover jwt/hmac/kms/cert/tls/ssh/vault/seed/
# private-key/key+cert file extensions, which the original list missed.)
