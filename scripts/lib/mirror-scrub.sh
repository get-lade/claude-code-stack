# Mirror-sync scrub guard (ADR-036 Job A). Sourced by scripts/mirror-sync.sh.
# No writes — pure read-only scan of an already-archived tree.
#
# Caller runs this with errexit suppressed (`if ! scrub_guard "$dir"`), so
# every fallible step is checked explicitly — never rely on set -e here
# (same style as scripts/lib/pack-installer.sh). Every fallible command
# below is the condition of an if/while, specifically so a nonzero exit
# inside this function body can never trip an inherited `set -e` before we
# get to inspect it.

# Deny-by-default mirrors .gitattributes (post cross-family review: an
# earlier allowlist-by-exclusion version of .gitattributes missed
# docs/ADRs/** and .claude/**, both real IP/secret leaks). Anything at the
# top level of the archived tree that isn't the known-safe installable-core
# set is a violation — this is a second, independent check of the same
# boundary .gitattributes enforces, so a misconfigured or bypassed
# .gitattributes still fails mirror-sync closed instead of silently
# shipping whatever git archive happened to include.

# Secret-value shapes, same class pack-installer.sh guards against
# (ADR-034), plus GitHub PATs (this repo's own primary credential class —
# CLAUDE_STACK_REPO_TOKEN, LADE_MIRROR_PUSH_TOKEN). sk_live_/sk-ant- require
# a 12+ char trailing key-body: without it this grep self-matches the
# pattern's own source (this file, pack-installer.sh, and docs that document
# the bare prefix literally) and short fixture strings elsewhere in the repo
# (e.g. tests/test-pack-installer.sh's planted "sk_live_abc123"). Real
# Stripe/Anthropic/GitHub tokens run well past these floors.
