# Claude Code Stack — cloud session bootstrap
#
# WHY: Claude Code *cloud* sessions (claude.ai/code on web + iOS) run in an
# ephemeral container. The repo is cloned fresh, but the user's laptop
# ~/.claude is NEVER synced up — so personal/global skills like /goodmorning
# and /handoff are not discoverable. This script installs the stack into the
# container's ~/.claude at session start so they load on every surface.
#
# USED TWO WAYS (see docs/CLOUD.md):
#   1. As the ENVIRONMENT setup script (configured per-environment in the
#      Claude Code web UI). Then EVERY cloud session of EVERY repo gets the
#      stack, without committing anything into each project.
#   2. Copied into a single repo's .claude/hooks/ by /project-init and wired
#      to that repo's SessionStart hook, so that repo self-bootstraps the
#      stack in cloud with no per-environment config.
#
# It clones this repo, then runs the idempotent installer: install.sh
# --mode=merge backs up ~/.claude and deep-merges JSON (user wins on conflict),
# so re-runs are safe.
#
# The repo is PUBLIC, so the clone needs no credential — no per-environment
# token, no setup-script secret. This makes the flow fully repo-driven:
# /project-init commits this script into a repo and the repo self-installs the
# stack in cloud with nothing configured on the environment.
#
# OPTIONAL ENV:
#   CLAUDE_STACK_REPO        default: github.com/bschonbrun/claude-code-stack
#   CLAUDE_STACK_REF         default: main
#   CLAUDE_STACK_TIER        default: 2
#   CLAUDE_STACK_REPO_TOKEN  only needed if the repo is ever made private
#                            again; if set, it is used (via GIT_ASKPASS, never
#                            in argv or .git/config). Never hardcode it.
#
# EXIT POLICY: best-effort. A network-blocked clone prints a prominent warning
# and exits 0 — it never hard-fails the cloud session.
